**Q1. Can I share my results with my partner?** <br> A: The Quiz is current in a test version, so the “sharing” function has not been enabled. You can look forward to this feature in the public launch of the Quiz in end 2023. For now, take a screenshot of your results for your own reference, or to share with your partner.&nbsp;<br> Discuss your results with your partner and sign up together for marriage programmes.

**Q2. Are there right or wrong answers?**&nbsp;<br> A: No. However, the more honest you are in your responses to the questions, the more accurate your feedback will be.

**Q3. What does the feedback imply for my relationship?**  <br> A: The feedback is a snapshot of your marital health at this moment. It identifies certain aspects of your relationship that you and your partner may wish to enhance, which can in turn increase your marital happiness and stability. The feedback is NOT an indication that your marriage will be unhappy, won’t last, or that you are not suited for a relationship.
