#### Our Marriage Journey Quiz:
**Q1. Can I share my results with my partner?** <br> The Quiz is current in a test version, so the “sharing” function has not been enabled. You can look forward to this feature in the public launch of the Quiz in end 2023. For now, take a screenshot of your results for your own reference, or to share with your partner.&nbsp;<br> Discuss your results with your partner and sign up together for marriage programmes. Click [here](https://familiesforlife.sg/discover-an-article/Pages/Why-You-Should-Attend-a-Marriage-Preparation-Course.aspx) to find out about marriage programmes supported by the Ministry of Social and Family Development!

**Q2. Are there right or wrong answers?**&nbsp;<br> No. However, the more honest you are in your responses to the questions, the more accurate your feedback will be.

**Q3. What does the feedback imply for my relationship?**  <br> The feedback is a snapshot of your marital health at this moment. It identifies certain aspects of your relationship that you and your partner may wish to enhance, which can in turn increase your marital happiness and stability. The feedback is NOT an indication that your marriage will be unhappy, won’t last, or that you are not suited for a relationship.

**Q4. If my results are different from my partner’s, does that mean that one of us answered incorrectly?**&nbsp;  <br>No, it is common for individuals in a relationship to have differences in how they view and experience the relationship. It is useful to discuss these differences as a couple, as doing so can enhance your mutual understanding and increase your marital happiness and stability.

**Q5. How often should I complete the quiz?**<br>Use the Quiz as a marital health check as often as you wish!&nbsp; You may wish to repeat it at least once a year, to ‘check in’ on how you are feeling about your relationship. We definitely recommend that you do so after major transitions or events in your relationship.&nbsp;<br><br> Our Marriage Journey Quiz will be ready for public launch in end 2023. Stay tuned for it!
