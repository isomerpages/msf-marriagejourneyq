**Welcome to Our Marriage Journey Quiz (OMJQ) User Testing!**<br><br>
We are currently doing user testing on OMJQ. There are 2 parts to this user testing - you will first complete the Quiz and receive your results, before completing a feedback form so we can learn more about your experience with the Quiz! This user testing will take about 15-20 minutes to complete.

**Our Marriage Journey Quiz** <br> <br> Whether you're soon-to-weds or seasoned partners, OMJQ offers an opportunity for you to gain insights into the dynamics of your relationship. Take this chance to identify strengths and areas for growth in positive bonding, communication and expectations! Use OMJQ as a relationship health check, especially after important life transitions or events.

**Please answer all items based on what you think of your relationship at this point in time:**

*   There are no right or wrong answers, but providing answers that best describe your view of your relationship will give you more accurate results.
*   For items where more than one option seems to describe your view of your relationship, please select the option that seems most accurate for you.
