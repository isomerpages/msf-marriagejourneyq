We recognise and respect your need for privacy and security as you visit and access our site. When you visit our site to view any pages, you do so without revealing any personal information. While we do not collect identifying information about visitors to our site, we do use standard software to collect information for the strict purpose of tracking activity on our site. This allows us to better understand how many people use our site and which pages and features are most popular. We do not identify you personally but only collect information relating to the following:

*   The technical details relating to your Internet service provider (e.g. IP address);
*   The website that referred you to us (if any);
*   The date and time the webpages were accessed; and
*   The webpage or webpages you commented on, shared with on the social media widget and on the Sharelist function.

There are instances where you may elect to provide us with personal information. For example, when you take part in our events, contests, send us a suggestion form or feedback form or an email, you may also be providing us personal information, including information that appears to you in the form or the message. This will typically include information like your name, mailing address, email address, contact details, identification number, the kind of request you are making, and any other information necessary to fulfil your request. This is always at your option; and the information is not transmitted to us until you specifically elect to send it to us. This information is used internally only for the purpose of fulfilling the request or for contacting you directly and is not given or sold to any other organisations. We may, however, use such information to provide you updates and information about our events and other family-related contents or materials. You may, of course, opt out of receiving future emails from us by following the instructions on our email or website.

To safeguard your personal data, all electronic storage and transmission of personal data are secured with appropriate security technologies.

This site may contain links to other websites whose data protection and privacy practices may differ from ours. We are not responsible for the content and privacy practices of these other websites and encourage you to consult the privacy statements or notices of those sites.

We hope you find our website useful and informative. We are always willing to answer questions and receive suggestions. If you have any questions or suggestions, please email us atÂ [engage@familiesforlife.sg](mailto:engage@familiesforlife.sg "engage@familiesforlife.sg"). Thank you.

\*We reserve the right to change our privacy policy at any time without prior notice. A revised policy statement will be posted on this website.
